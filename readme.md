## About
Nextcloud's Spreed app lacks a few features like GFM & URL embeds, so I've made my own client.

## Setup

This project is built w/ Deno, so be sure to have Deno installed.

1. Open a terminal in the repository's directory
1. Run `deno run --allow-net --allow-read main.ts`
1. Profit! (Or head to 127.0.0.1:8081)
